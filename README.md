# Lines

My first android app, now in browser.
The app was written in processing, this one is rewritten in p5.js.

Download the apk: https://github.com/thatguyshzr/Lines/raw/master/Lines.apk

To open in browser: https://thatguyshzr.github.io/lines_for_browser/index.html

If its running slow in your phone, use a different browser.
